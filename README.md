# WebBlog Python
Here we have created a blog site using python framework(FLASK).It is a dynamic blog site and the db used in this is mysql.

#### Note
For Sending mail we have used google mail server.

As per gmail guidelines you need to enable 2 step verification for your google account.

And then after you have to generate a 16 digit app password which should be used in place of your gmail account password.

If any one of the above will be missing then you will get an smtp error.
